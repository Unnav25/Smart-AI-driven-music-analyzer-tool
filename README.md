PROJECT TITLE:"SMART AI-DRIVEN MUSIC ANALYZER TOOL"

The methodology for this project is structured into several stages, each contributing to the creation of a modular, scalable and intelligent music recognition system.

The system consists of the following components:

1) Audio Input Module: Captures audio using the microphone and forwards it to the recognition engine.

2) Recognition Engine: Utilizes pretrained model to analyze the audio and extract chords and genre.

3) Metadata Module: Queries the database and retrieves associated details like artist, title and duration.

4) User Feedback System: Prompts user confirmation post-recognition and stores the response for further training.

5) Recommendation System: Based on the recognized genre,it suggests related songs.
